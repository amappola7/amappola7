# Hi! I'm Amappola âœ¨
I am a Junior Frontend Developer. I am passionate about being part of the architects of the future and thus, building the world we will live in tomorrow, one line of code at a time.

I enjoy implementing creative solutions through programming and creating products that impact the lives of my users. I never stop learning, I love discovering new technologies and new ways to be better at my job.
